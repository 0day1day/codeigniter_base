Why?
===============
I wanted an easy way to install the latest and greatest web server via source without needing to manually go though all the compiling steps.

Requirements
===============
Debian based system (Only been tested on a vanilla install of Debian 6.0.1a)

What do the scripts do?
===============
**ci_install_source:** Coming soon
This will install `nginx/lighttpd`, `php5`, `php-apc`, `mongodb` via source

**ci_install_apt:** Currently only lightTPD
Incase the source method is broken for what ever reason use this.
This will install `nginx/lighttpd`, `php5`, `php-apc`, `mongodb` using the apt package manager (apt-get).
*update with exact versions

Change log
